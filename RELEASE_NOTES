UNRELEASED
==========

1. Replace CORBA::string_dup with Tango::string_dup (#474)
2. Fix memory leak on get_device_property() on Windows when code compiled with Visual Studio 10 or older (#439, #488)
3. Fix cxx_fwd_att occasional failure (#384,#428,#493)
4. Fix "Change event subscription blind to change events right after device server restart" issue (#359,#503). 
This bug fix may trigger the reception of 2 consecutive events having possibly the same attribute value during the 
Device Server startup phase.
5. Added asyn_reconnection test (#502)
6. Fix client crash in case of asynchronous write_attribute executed immediately after reconnection (#502)

9.3.2
=====

1. Add Tango::string_free and fix memory leak in zmq_event_subscription_change() (#457,#460)
2. Fix bug impacting device servers using dynamic attributes (#458,#459)
3. Fix reconnection issues when a client subscribes to several events (#455)
4. Fix some event compatibility issues with device server <= Tango 8 (#456)
5. Fix event field in EventData structure passed to user's callback (broken in Tango 9.3.0 and 9.3.1)
6. Fix attribute name in EventData structure passed to user's callback for Attribute Config events
7. Fix a bug occurring when an event is pushed at the same time as an event (re)subscription occurs (#484, #485)
8. Fix event name (EventData.event) passed to client's Callback after Tango 9 attribute reconnection (#486)
9. Integrate Coveralls and Sonar
10. Tests: Split runner executable into several executables. Disable log4tango bench test.
11. Doxygen: upgrade to doxygen 1.8.13. Fix some doxygen warnings.

9.3.1
=====

1. Add -pedantic for GCC/Clang and debug mode (#441). This change can generate 
   errors with very old compilers (e.g. gcc 3.4.6) when compiling the lib debug 
   version. Please remove manually -pedantic flag in configure/CMakeLists.txt if
   you need to compile the debug version on a very old compiler.
2. DServerSignal: Include errno header instead of trying to manually get the declaration right (#441)
3. Remove GNU_CXX definition for GCC/Clang (#441)
4. filedatabase.cpp: Remove stray semicolon (#441)
5. FileDatabase: Use correct format specifier for unsigned arguments to sscanf (#441)
6. EventConsumer::connect_event: Fix misleading indentation (#441)
7. PollThread: Fix multiline macro definitions (#451)
8. Generate static library (#17) and fix compilation definitions (#437)
9. Replace asserts in EventConsumer::initialize_received_from_admin with exceptions (#453)

9.3.0
=====

1. Fix FQDN events (#423,#315)
   Limitations:
     - in case DeviceProxy is used for event subscription client will get incorrect value 
	 in the event callback if short domain name is used in env.TANGO_HOST 
	 e.g. hzgc103 -> hzgc103.desy.de
2. Fix memory leak when pipe event is sent and there is no client (#447,#448)
3. Set the ZMQ Receive Buffer High Water Mark only if it changes (#444,#445) 
   to reduce the impact of a bug in ZMQ 4.2.0 and ZMQ 4.2.1.

9.2.8
=====

1. Cmake release targets #438 - Fix appveyor build. 
   Install include files in <install_prefix>/include/tango directory instead of 
   <install_prefix>/include.

9.2.7
=====

1. CPU load when device has large number of attributes #404 
2. push event performance issue #244
3. Fix issue with polling not starting automatically on dynamic attributes #427
4. Tango 9 lts remove zmq hpp #421
5. remove event subscription sleeps on linux #415
6. Fix bug in event name when pushing an error event to IDL5 clients. #400
7. Tango 9 LTS fix#395 (Inserting const C string in DeviceData) #396
